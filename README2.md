## How does the trading algorithm work?
The goal of the algorithm is to balance the teams while taking into account the preferences of the GMs.

Here's the [current implementation](https://github.com/chriscremer/TPL/blob/main/streamlit_site/algo3.py) for selecting a trade:
1. Make a list of all possible trades (exclude team captains, wildcards, etc.)
2. Pick the trade that best balances the teams (with a preference towards trades that make both teams happy)
3. Repeat until teams are balanced or we've hit a limit on number of trades

Once bids are in each week, we run the algorithm to balance the teams. So the job of a GM is to accurately access the value of the players in the league (no more negotiating trades). 

### Notes:
- You can protect two players, they will not be traded.
- The total of all your overbids can't be above $10k, and the total of all your underbids can't be below $-10k. 
- The algorithm is capped at max 4 trades per team per week. This is to prevent too much roster turnover.

## Tell Me More

The main thing the algo is doing is making a list of all possible trades, then picking the one that reduces the standard deviation of the team salaries (bring all team salaries closer to the average).

### What excludes a trade from being considered?
- If a trade increases the standard deviation of the team salaries (reduces parity), it's excluded
- If a player is protected, a team captain, or a wildcard
- Trades must be of the same gender

### How do we take into consideration the preferences/bids of the GMs?

After making a list of all acceptable trades, the algorithm will groups the trades into three categories:
1. Happy trades
2. Somewhat happy trades
3. Neutral trades


### What are "happy trades"?

A happy trade is a trade where both GMs think they're receiving a player that is worth more than the player they're giving up. 

<p align="center">
  <b>
  Happiness = (my bid for the player I'm receiving) - (my bid for the player I'm giving up)
  </b>
</p>

For example, I have John Smith on my team and you have Zack Brown. I think John Smith is worth 40 and Zack Brown is worth 50, whereas you think John Smith is worth 60 and Zack Brown is worth 30. If we trade John Smith for Zack Brown, I receive a player that I think is worth 10 more than the player I'm giving up, and you receive a player that you think is worth 30 more than the player you're giving up. So this is a happy trade because we both think we're receiving a player that is worth more than the player we're giving up.


### How does the algorithm prioritize "happy trades"?

If there are any happy trades available, the algorithm will pick the happy trade that reduces the standard deviation of the team salaries the most.

### What if there are no happy trades available?

If there are no happy trades available, the algorithm will look for "somewhat happy trades". A "somewhat happy trade" is a trade where the sum of the happiness of the two GMs is positive. 

So if I'm giving up a player I think is worth 40 and receiving a player I think is worth 30, my happiness is -10. If you're giving up a player you think is worth 20 and receiving a player you think is worth 50, your happiness is 30. The sum of our happiness is 20, so this is a "somewhat happy trade".

If there are no happy trades available, the algorithm will pick the somewhat happy trade that reduces the standard deviation of the team salaries the most.

### What if there are no happy or somewhat happy trades available?

If there are no happy or somewhat happy trades available, the algorithm will pick the trade that reduces the standard deviation of the team salaries the most.
In other words, the algorithm will simply try to balance the teams (increase parity) regardless of what the GMs bid.

## FAQ

### How is a player's salary determined?
- A player's salary is the average of the GM bids for that player.

### What if I don't know the value of a player?
- Just leave it as the default value, which is the average bid of all GMs from the previous week.

### What if I'm too busy one week to update my bid on players?
- No problem, the algorithm will still balance your team. Your bids will be set to the average bid of all GMs from the previous week.

### Are there ways to exploit the algorithm?
- Possibly, but we can adjust it throughout the season to address any issues we encounter. In general, the optimal strategy will be to bid what each player is worth.

### How can we add special trade rules each week?
- We could add special bidding rules each week, for example:
  - Bid the same amount for three of the players on your team.
  - Bid the max value for five players in the league.
  - Have half your team be above some value, and the other half below that value. 

### How will GM salaries be determined, since GMs cant be bidded on?
- We'll use a simple linear regression model to predict salary given stats.

### If we adopt this system, what does a GM need to do?
- login once a week and adjust their bids for the players that they want to acquire/trade away
- organize their team (find subs if necessary)


### What effects would this algorithm have?
- If the demand for a player increases, their salary will increase. So if a GM wants to hold on to a in-demand player, they'll have to pay more for them. So it becomes harder for GMs to hog players.
- If the demand for a player is low, their salary will decrease, which should increase the demand for them. The result is players being accurately valued.
- If a player has a good, bad or misses a game, it doesn't necessarily affect what GMs think of them, so their salary doesn't necessarily change. Additionaly, there's no incentive to sandbag.




###	What ability does a GM have to control their roster? Thereâ€™s a lots of elements to consider when putting together a roster (skill sets, personalities, areas of strength or weakness currently present on the team, etc.) and at some point roster stability counts for a lot. 

- One way a GM can control their roster is by protecting their most valued players. See: [How are most valued players protected?](#how-are-most-valued-players-protected)
- GMs can also bid low on players they want to trade away, and high on players they want to acquire. This will increase the likelihood of the algorithm making the trades they want. See: [How do we take into consideration the preferences/bids of the GMs?](#how-do-we-take-into-consideration-the-preferencesbids-of-the-gms)


### Could this system lead to increased trade activity and roster turnover?

- Currently, the algorithm is capped at max 3 trades per team per week. This is to prevent too much roster turnover. 
- We could reduce this number throughout the season to reduce roster turnover.

###	What if two (or more) GMs bid the same amount?

- There are a number of factors that the algorithm will consider to determine which trade is made:
  - First, the algorithm will prioritize trades that make both teams happy. So it depends what players are on your roster and what the other GMs are bidding for them.
  - If the bids are all equal, the algorithm will prioritize trades that reduce the standard deviation of the team salaries the most. So your team's salary will be the deciding factor.
  - If all of those are equal (very rare), then the algorithm will randomly pick one of the trades.


### Is this dynamic pricing or ebay pricing? If someone is traded away during a trading session could I change my bid to try and get them back?

- This is ebay pricing / blind bidding. You can adjust your preferences during some time period, then once the time is up the algorithm will run and determine the trades. So you can't adjust your bids based on what other GMs are doing. Ideally, you should bid what you think each player is worth so that you acquire players that you think are undervalued and trade away players that you think are overvalued.

### Does this system leave me open to having injured or absent players traded to my team?

- Yes this is possible, but you can reduce the likelihood of this happening by bidding low on players you don't want to acquire.

## TODOs

- [ ] Ability to upload/download the salaries/bids for the whole league, so GMs can write their bids in a excel sheet then upload instead of using all the sliders
- [ ] Add all player stats to the site
- [ ] Show change in player salary over time
